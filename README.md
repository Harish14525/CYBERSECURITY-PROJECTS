# CYBERSECURITY-PROJECTS
🛡️ Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Portfolio – Harish Babu G

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository showcases a collection of real-world-inspired projects spanning offensive security, infrastructure hardening, cloud deployments, Linux system administration, and threat detection. Each project reflects my hands-on experience in simulated and production-like environments.

Each folder contains a detailed README with technical walkthroughs, configurations, tools used, and relevant screenshots.


📂 Project Index

1. 🔍 Penetration Testing & VAPT
  
Project: Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment of Zero Bank's Network  
Tools: SQLmap, Metasploit, Wazuh, Gobuster, Nikto, Kali Linux, Nessus  
Summary: Conducted a comprehensive penetration test on Zero Bank’s internal infrastructure including VSFTPD, DVWA, Mutillidae, and Active Directory. Discovered 28 critical vulnerabilities across network, application, and system layers. Provided remediation strategies to enhance the organization’s security posture.

2. 🧪 Ethical Hacking in a Virtual Lab
  
Project: Ethical Hacking and Network Security Analysis  
Tools: Wazuh, Wireshark, Kali Linux, Metasploit, Hydra, Nmap  
Summary: Simulated real-world cyberattacks in a controlled lab environment. Exploited vulnerabilities across Windows, Linux, Joomla, and AD systems. Monitored and analyzed incidents using SIEM tools and performed forensic inspection of attack traces.

3. 🧠 Advanced Linux Administration
  
Project: Advanced Linux System Administration for Cybersecurity  
Tools: Shell Scripting, Logwatch, UFW, BIND9, Logrotate  
Summary: Engineered a secure Linux server environment with automated system health checks, DNS/DHCP services, advanced firewall configurations, and centralized log/report management to support cybersecurity operations.

4. ☁️ Cloud Computing & Containerized Architecture
  
Project: Cloud Infrastructure and Dockerized Web App on AWS  
Tools: AWS EC2, VPC, S3, Docker, MySQL, WordPress  
Summary: Designed and deployed a 3-tier Dockerized web application infrastructure on AWS. Implemented VPC architecture, container orchestration with Docker Compose, secure storage using S3, and service resiliency through NGINX load balancing.

5. 🔐 Multi-Layered Information Security Systems
  
Project: Implementation and Testing of Multi-Layered Security  
Tools: ModSecurity, UFW, OpenSSL, Nessus  
Summary: Deployed layered defense mechanisms including Web Application Firewall (ModSecurity), strong cryptographic implementations (AES, RSA, HMAC), and firewall configurations. Performed vulnerability assessments and validated system integrity.

6. ⚔️ Exploitation & Network Attacks in Virtual Lab
  
Project: Scanning and Exploitation of Information Systems  
Tools: RouterSploit, Metasploit, Bettercap, Hydra, Wireshark  
Summary: Demonstrated a wide range of offensive techniques including ARP/DNS spoofing, DoS simulation, WEP/WPA2 cracking, router exploitation, and privilege escalation in a sandboxed virtual network.
